#MH-PSP-DLC
#MHPSPDLC archive of all PSP Monster Hunter versions DLC pages

This fork is mostly to backup really specific combinations of DLC saves, for my own purposes and for anyone running these games on the native hardware. 

##But why?

Because installing [mhef](https://gitlab.com/svanheulen/mhef) was a pain in the ass, and since the DLC servers are still accessible in-game, why not? I'm not exactly fond of using the MHFU save editor OR emulating on PPSSPP.
The archive on the original branch archives saves in a way that's designed for adding them onto an emulated save; this aims to archive saves in a way that someone on native hardware could use.

More specifically, the MHFU save editor is just that -- it doesn't support F2, and I wanted to abuse Ceanataur SUUSS and the original Akantor Bow before getting into G-Rank content. There are a few other advantages to playing F2 first, like:
* Being able to get several awards on Page 1 without having to wade into G-Rank (e.g., Farm awards, monster size crowns...)
* The original Dos music for large monster fights
* Normal bloodsplatter

If you find this useful in any way, feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RF-TQ/MH-PSP-DLC/issues) if you'd like some specific combination of DLC on a fresh save to be added here, be it F2, Unite, or otherwise. The only limitation is that, as with anything downloaded through the DLC server in-game, you're only limited to six quests and the bonus content.
